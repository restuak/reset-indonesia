# RAKYATJELITA: The 17+8 Tuntutan Rakyat Digital Archive
A resilient platform for documenting Indonesia's 17+8 Demands movement. #RESETINDONESIA

This project is a modern web application designed to serve as a permanent digital archive of the 17+8 Tuntutan Rakyat (17+8 Demands from the People) movement. It documents the 17 immediate and 8 long-term demands that were formulated to unify public grievances during the August 2025 protests in Indonesia.

The application’s design language incorporates the symbolic colors of the movement: "Brave Pink" representing the female protesters on the front lines, and "Hero Green" symbolizing the victims of police actions.
