# RESETINDONESIA: The 17+8 Tuntutan Rakyat Digital Archive
A resilient platform for documenting Indonesia's 17+8 Demands movement.

This project is a modern web application designed to serve as a permanent digital archive of the 17+8 Tuntutan Rakyat (17+8 Demands from the People) movement. It documents the 17 immediate and 8 long-term demands that were formulated to unify public grievances during the August 2025 protests in Indonesia.

The applicationâ€™s design language incorporates the symbolic colors of the movement: "Brave Pink," representing the female protesters on the front lines, and "Hero Green," symbolizing the victims of police actions.

## Features

Collapsible Sections: A streamlined display of demands using smooth, collapsible components.
Static and Performant Content: The application is built using Static Site Generation (SSG) to ensure ultra-fast load times and global accessibility.
