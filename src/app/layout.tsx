It documents the 17 immediate and 8 long-term demands that were formulated to unify public grievances during the August 2025 protests in Indonesia. The applicationâ€™s design language incorporates the symbolic colors of the movement: #BravePink, representing the female protesters on the front lines, and #HeroGreen, symbolizing the victims of police actions.",
